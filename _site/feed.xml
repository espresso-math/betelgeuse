        <title>Secret Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying not to think is the best way for anybody to be happy. There’s just so much information around you,
floating about and occasionally, just occasionally, making sense. I picked up the habit long ago of quietly
reciting a poem in my mind when I was scared, trying to clear my mind. Recently, and I mean today, I started the habit of 
focusing on the now and not thinking about anything at all by reciting a small scrap of poem in mind over and over again. 
The results were immediate and pronounced. It was like ducking your head under water. Immediately as you head goes below 
water, all sounds becomes indistinct and eerie. I found out that most of my troubles could be simply shut out. I could
&lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to listen and to pick up each individual tendril of thought from one another and analyses them. Most of what I 
thought each moment was unnecessary. Instead of constantly analyzing the world around me, I could &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to focus on just 
what was important. If you’d like to try this out, I recommend somewhere solitary and silent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kubrick&#39;s 2001: A space Odyssey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Space stations rotate to simulate gravity and a spindle shaped spacecraft drifts lazily through the cosmos all to the tune of Johann Strauss’s (II) The Blue Danube. All the while, space hostesses go about serving food that has to be drunk through tubes, in zero g and BBC 12 plays on what must be, the first screen time of the Apple Ipad. Visually stunning, sometimes cold and aloft but in the end, epic and prophetic, Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey is a one of a kind movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey can be understood in four parts. No actor appears in more than one part with the exception of Dave Bowman, who is of course the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; character in part IV. Each part is thematically and stylistically and even technologically different. The most important ‘character’ in A Space Odyssey is not astronaut Dave Bowman nor is it Mr Smug-know-it-all Floyd Heywood. It can only be the Monolith. The sleek and mysterious black slab that mankind encounters. We do not know if there is just one Monolith or many. Clearly it is Alien. Euclidean perfection begin as good a guess of intelligent life as the primes. Both are explicitly absent in the natural universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-i-dawn-of-man&quot;&gt;Part I: Dawn of Man&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the barren wastelands of prehistoric Africa, Kubrick’s Man-Apes make war on the Tapirs and with members of other wandering tribes. Man, in this primeval state does not kill but is killed instead. Here’s Kubrick’s wonderful photography comes to the fore as frame after frame of harsh beautiful landscape is caught on camera and offers a counterpoint to the unforgiving cruel life that the Man-Apes live. Then one day, out of the blue, the Monolith appears before them. Later during the day, a Man-ape discovers the first tool – a thick Tapir bone with a handle like an axe – and Richard Strauss’s &lt;em&gt;Also Sprach Zarathustra&lt;/em&gt; plays in all its glory. We are to understand that somehow aliens have give the Man-ape a slight evolutionary nudge on the long road forward. This is my favorite scene all of filmdom. The Man-ape cocks it head to the sides as it considers the bone-axe. You can almost hear the gears falling into place as he makes the connection between the inanimate bone and the tool that will give him unlimited food and power. As the opening to Also Sprach Zarathustra plays, he uses the bone-axe as a hammer to break the bones which lay before him. In this brief moment he is no longer a Man-ape but becomes something more. To be sure the violence is there, but the grace is almost artistic and combined with Richard Strauss’s score he comes the great conductor of both the music and his own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day the tribe feasts on the flesh of dead Tapirs. The enemy descends on the watering hole. But our Man-apes stand nearly erect with each holding a bone-axe of their own while the enemy is down on all four with teeth barred.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Alternative Proof to Euler&#39;s Theorem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I read a proof due to Euler, it often leaves me speechless. Leonard Euler is, and always will be, my favourite mathematician. I will now attempt to give an alternative proof of his famous Theorem that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;maths display=&quot;&quot;&gt;
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i\sin \theta
&lt;/maths&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic sketch for this proof came to me when I was reading Richard Feynman’s seminal undergraduate textbook, Lectures on Physics. In the book, while attempting to explain the above equation, Feynman asks us to visualize what would happen if \theta was to be infinitesmally small. I ask you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As theta becomes zero, the function approaches closer and closer towards one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wikipedia Math</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some resolutions must be kept so I will try to keep this one. I am on quest, to read the whole of the Wikipedia Math portal collection consisting of over 33000 articles. One day, as I was reading a Wikipedia article on Harmonic Progressions, I came across the Caterpillar problem. The problem, simply stated was this: A rubber band is being stretched at a uniform rate of 1 m/s. At the same time a Caterpillar starts from one end of the rubber band at a rate of 1 cm/s. Can the caterpillar reach the other end? The answer surprisingly enough is yes and the reason is because the Harmonic sum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;maths display=&quot;&quot;&gt;
1 + \frac{1}{2}  + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \cdots
&lt;/maths&gt;

&lt;p&gt;diverges. So I thought to myself, what other little gems must be here, waiting for me to find?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just so I don’t give up, help me out by teasing me if I don’t post an update every single day. My email is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alxpkn@jla.pii.at&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breakup&quot;&gt;Breakup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are 33,000 articles. I could conceivably do about twenty articles every day. That’s over 1650 days or nearly 236 weeks or just over four and a half years. Yup. I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fortress</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Belogorsk fortress was situated at a distance of forty 
versts from Orenburg. The road lay along the steep bank of the 
Yaik. The river was not yet frozen over, and its leaden current
showed dark and dreary between the monotonous snow-covered
banks. ON either side &lt;a href=&quot;https://pluge.com&quot;&gt;stretched the Kirghisz steppe&lt;/a&gt;. I was plunged 
in meditation, for the greaer part melancholy. Garrison life
held few attractions for me. I tried to imagine what Captain
Mironov, my future superior officer, would be like, and formed
a picture of a severe, bad-tempered old man, oblivious to all but 
the service, and ready to arrest me and put me on bread and
water for the most trivial offence. The dusk was beginning to
fall. We were driving at a fair speed. “Is it far to the fortress?”
I asked my driver. “Not very,” he replied. &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.l5.ca/5as7F37.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Puskin at work&quot; class=&quot;wrap-around&quot; /&gt; 
“It’s just comming into sight, yonder.” I looked all around me, expecting to see formidable
bastions, turrets, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://asshole.com&quot;&gt;ramparts&lt;/a&gt;; but I could see nothing 
but a huddle of wooden buildings surrounded by a log fence.
On one side of the road were three or four haystacks, half-
covered with snow, on the other a tumble-down mill with idly
drooping bark sails. “Where’s the fortress?” I asked in surprise.
“There it is,” replied the driver, pointing to the hamlet into 
which we were turning at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the gate I saw an ancient iron cannon; the streets were narrow an crooked; the
houses low and ost of them had straw thatches. I ordered the 
driver to go on to the commandant’s office, and a minute later
the sleigh drew up befor a small wooden house, standing on 
high ground, next to a wooden church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cats-funeral&quot;&gt;The Cat’s Funeral&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody came to meet me. I went into the porch and opened
the door into the passage. An invalided soldier was perched on
a table putting a blue patch on the elbow of a green uniform. I
told him to announce my arrival. “You can go in, Sir” he 
replied. “They’re at home.” I went into a clean little room, 
furnished in the old-fashioned style. In one corner was a crockery
cupboard, on the wall hung an officer’s diploma, framed and
glazed; next to it were crude pictures representing the storming
of Kistrin and Ochakov, “The Choice of a Bride”, and “The
Cat’s Funeral”. At the window sat an old lady in a waddded
jacket with a kerchief on her head. She was winding wool which
a one-eyed ancient in officer’s uniform held up for her aroun
his outstrethced hands. “What can I do for you, Sir?” asked
the old woman going on with her occupation. I repied that I 
had come to serve in the army and considered it my duty to
report to the captian, and here I turned to the on-eyed old man,
whom I took for the commnadant. But the mistress of the house
interrupted the speech I had prepared beforehand. “Ivan Kuzmich
is out,” she said. “He had gone to visit Father Gerasim;
but it is no matter, Sir. I am his wife, an you are very welcome. 
Take a seat, Sir.” She called a servant-girl, whom she 
told to go for the sergeant. The old man observed me inquisitively
from his solitary eye. “May I venture to enquire what 
regiment you were in?” he asked. I satisfied his curiosity. “And
may I ask,” he continued, “what caused you to leave the Guards
for a garrison?” I replied that such had been the will of my 
superiors. “For conduct unworthy of an officer of the Guards
I presume,” continued my importunate interrogator. “Enough
of you prattle,” said the captain’s lady, “can’t you see the 
young man is tired from his journey - let him alone! (Hold
your hands up, do!) And you, Sir,” she went on, addressing me,
“don’t grieve at having been packed off to this out-of-the-way
spot, You’re not the first, you won’t be the last. You won’t 
mind it, after you get used to it. It’s over four years since Alexei
Ivanovich Shvabrin was transferred to us for manslaughter.
The Lord knows what made him do it; you see, he and some 
lieutenant went to the outskirts of the town, and took their
swords with them, and started prodding at each other; and
Alexei Ivanovich ran the lieutenant throught the body, and that
in the presence of two witnesses. Can’t be helped! It might 
happen to anybody.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then the sergeant, a stalwart young Cossack, entered the 
room. “Maximich,” said the old lady, “find quarters for the
officer, clean ones.” “Yes, Vasilissa Yegorovna,” replied the 
sergeant. “Shall I quarter His Honour on Ivan Polezhaev?”
“No, no, Maximich,” said the captian’s lady. “It’s crowded
enough there as it is, but Polezhaev is my friend, and understands
that we are his superiors” Take the officer … what’s
your name, Sir? Pyotr Andreich. Take Pyotr Andreich to 
Semen Kuzov. He let his horse into my vegetable garden, the 
rascal! Well, Maximich, is everything in order?”&lt;/p&gt;
