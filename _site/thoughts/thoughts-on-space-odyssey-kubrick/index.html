    <p>Space stations rotate to simulate gravity and a spindle shaped spacecraft drifts lazily through the cosmos all to the tune of Johann Strauss’s (II) The Blue Danube. All the while, space hostesses go about serving food that has to be drunk through tubes, in zero g and BBC 12 plays on what must be, the first screen time of the Apple Ipad. Visually stunning, sometimes cold and aloft but in the end, epic and prophetic, Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey is a one of a kind movie.</p>

<p>2001: A Space Odyssey can be understood in four parts. No actor appears in more than one part with the exception of Dave Bowman, who is of course the <em>only</em> character in part IV. Each part is thematically and stylistically and even technologically different. The most important ‘character’ in A Space Odyssey is not astronaut Dave Bowman nor is it Mr Smug-know-it-all Floyd Heywood. It can only be the Monolith. The sleek and mysterious black slab that mankind encounters. We do not know if there is just one Monolith or many. Clearly it is Alien. Euclidean perfection begin as good a guess of intelligent life as the primes. Both are explicitly absent in the natural universe.</p>

<h4 id="part-i-dawn-of-man">Part I: Dawn of Man</h4>

<p>In the barren wastelands of prehistoric Africa, Kubrick’s Man-Apes make war on the Tapirs and with members of other wandering tribes. Man, in this primeval state does not kill but is killed instead. Here’s Kubrick’s wonderful photography comes to the fore as frame after frame of harsh beautiful landscape is caught on camera and offers a counterpoint to the unforgiving cruel life that the Man-Apes live. Then one day, out of the blue, the Monolith appears before them. Later during the day, a Man-ape discovers the first tool – a thick Tapir bone with a handle like an axe – and Richard Strauss’s <em>Also Sprach Zarathustra</em> plays in all its glory. We are to understand that somehow aliens have give the Man-ape a slight evolutionary nudge on the long road forward. This is my favorite scene all of filmdom. The Man-ape cocks it head to the sides as it considers the bone-axe. You can almost hear the gears falling into place as he makes the connection between the inanimate bone and the tool that will give him unlimited food and power. As the opening to Also Sprach Zarathustra plays, he uses the bone-axe as a hammer to break the bones which lay before him. In this brief moment he is no longer a Man-ape but becomes something more. To be sure the violence is there, but the grace is almost artistic and combined with Richard Strauss’s score he comes the great conductor of both the music and his own life.</p>

<p>The next day the tribe feasts on the flesh of dead Tapirs. The enemy descends on the watering hole. But our Man-apes stand nearly erect with each holding a bone-axe of their own while the enemy is down on all four with teeth barred.</p>
