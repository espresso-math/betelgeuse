Trying not to think is the best way for anybody to be happy. There's just so much information around you,
floating about and occasionally, just occasionally, making sense. I picked up the habit long ago of quietly
reciting a poem in my mind when I was scared, trying to clear my mind. Recently, and I mean today, I started the habit of 
focusing on the now and not thinking about anything at all by reciting a small scrap of poem in mind over and over again. 
The results were immediate and pronounced. It was like ducking your head under water. Immediately as you head goes below 
water, all sounds becomes indistinct and eerie. I found out that most of my troubles could be simply shut out. I could
*choose* not to listen and to pick up each individual tendril of thought from one another and analyses them. Most of what I 
thought each moment was unnecessary. Instead of constantly analyzing the world around me, I could *choose* to focus on just 
what was important. If you'd like to try this out, I recommend somewhere solitary and silent.
