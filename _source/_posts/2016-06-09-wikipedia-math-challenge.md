Some resolutions must be kept so I will try to keep this one. I am on quest, to read the whole of the Wikipedia Math portal collection consisting of over 33000 articles. One day, as I was reading a Wikipedia article on Harmonic Progressions, I came across the Caterpillar problem. The problem, simply stated was this: A rubber band is being stretched at a uniform rate of 1 m/s. At the same time a Caterpillar starts from one end of the rubber band at a rate of 1 cm/s. Can the caterpillar reach the other end? The answer surprisingly enough is yes and the reason is because the Harmonic sum

1 + \frac{1}{2}  + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \cdots
</maths>

diverges. So I thought to myself, what other little gems must be here, waiting for me to find?

And just so I don't give up, help me out by teasing me if I don't post an update every single day. My email is `alxpkn@jla.pii.at`.


## Breakup

So there are 33,000 articles. I could conceivably do about twenty articles every day. That's over 1650 days or nearly 236 weeks or just over four and a half years. Yup. I can live with that.
