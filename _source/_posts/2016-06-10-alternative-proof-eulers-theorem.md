When I read a proof due to Euler, it often leaves me speechless. Leonard Euler is, and always will be, my favourite mathematician. I will now attempt to give an alternative proof of his famous Theorem that

<maths display>
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i\sin \theta

The basic sketch for this proof came to me when I was reading Richard Feynman's seminal undergraduate textbook, Lectures on Physics. In the book, while attempting to explain the above equation, Feynman asks us to visualize what would happen if \theta was to be infinitesmally small. I ask you to do the same. 

As theta becomes zero, the function approaches closer and closer towards one.
